An interactive REPL for interacting with your running script.

Usage:

var {repl} = require("./repl");
repl.start(function(cmd) {
             console.log(JSON.stringify(eval(cmd)));
           });

This REPL is nice to use together with emacs.

To set up ringo with the repl in emacs:

Add this to your .emacs file

(defun ringo-start (file)
  (interactive "f")
  (cua-mode)
  (setq explicit-shell-file-name "/path/to/ringo")
  (setq explicit-ringo-args (list file))
  (shell)
  )

Emacs will prompt for a file, enter the path of your app file containing the repl code, and you should have a buffer in emacs displaying your interative REPL :)
